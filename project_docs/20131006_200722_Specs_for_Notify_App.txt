OVERVIEW:
A Rails app with models including
Users, Gmail Accounts, Emails, Notifications, Rules

DATA MODELS AND FUNCTIONALITY:
- User accounts
	- Each account has multiple connected Gmail accounts
	- Each account has multiple enabled Rules (see Rules, below)
	- User will have an account administration page where they can edit basic info (contact email, name, password) and connect or disconnect Gmail accounts
	- User will have a Dashboard page where they can view all current Notifications (see Notifications, below). Each Notification will link to its corresponding Email.
- Gmail accounts
	- Users will have to authorize access to each Gmail account
	- Site will periodically scan those email accounts for new emails matching particular Rules (see Rules, below)
	- and copy the matching emails into the database
- Emails 
	- Emails will store all email metadata and textual content
	- Every email copied into the database will generate a corresponding Notification (see Notifications, below)
- Notifications 
	- The Notification will be a one-line summary of the corresponding Email, generated according to simple coded rules
	- The Notification will remember what Gmail account and User it belongs to, and what Email it corresponds to
	- The Notification will have a status of “Read” or “Unread”
- Rules
	- Each rule will consist of three Regex patterns
	- to match against Sender, Subject, and Email content, respectively
	- One, two, or three of those Regex patterns may be filled in, and thus active

PRIMARY PAGES:
- User Dashboard
	- The Dashboard will consist of a list of Notifications, color-coded as “Read” or “Unread”
	-  Notifications can be clicked to mark as “Read”, which will result in a background color change for that row.
	- Each Notification will link to its corresponding Email
- User Account Management Page
	- Edit account info
	- Connect or disconnect Gmail accounts
	- Activate or Deactivate Rules
- User signup page (front page)
